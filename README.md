# DeepShark
 A project to apply deep reinforcement learning to the game of Texas hold 'em poker.

The name of the project, DeepShark, is a compounding of the phrases "Deep learning" and "card Shark."  Deep learning refers to machine learning methods that utilize artificial neural network architectures, while a "shark" is slang for a highly skilled poker player.  I would like to train an ANN to play poker well, hence DeepShark.
